1. E (correct)
2. B (correct)
3. C / N^3 (they were 2 separate nested loops)
4. C / N^3 (wrong it is N^4, this is because p approaches n^2 as the loop continues)
5. A (max of N^3 and N^4)
6. A, D (sometimes)
7. A (maybe, the average case could be faster), D
8. C (correct)
9. A
10. D (not sure how to solve) (correct)
11. B (correct)
12. A
13. E
14. C
15. B
16. B
